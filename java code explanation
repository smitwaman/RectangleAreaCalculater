This program allows users to calculate the area of a rectangle by providing the length and width.

Imports: The program imports the Scanner class from the java.util package, which is used to read input from the user.

Class Definition: The RectangleAreaCalculator class is defined as a public class. This is the main class of the program.

Main Method: The main method is the entry point of the program. It creates a new Scanner object to read input from the user and initializes a boolean variable exit to false.

While Loop: The program enters a while loop that continues until the user chooses to exit (exit becomes true).

Menu: Inside the loop, a menu is displayed to the user using System.out.println. The user is prompted to choose an option: either calculate the area or exit the program.

Switch Statement: The user's choice is read using scanner.nextInt() and processed using a switch statement. If the user chooses option 1, the calculateArea method is called. If the user chooses option 2, the exit flag is set to true, and a farewell message is displayed. If the user selects any other option, an error message is displayed, and the loop continues.

Close Scanner: After the loop ends, the Scanner object is closed to release system resources.

calculateArea Method: This method takes a Scanner object as a parameter. It prompts the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle using System.out.print and scanner.nextDouble(). It then calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula length * width and displays the result using System.out.println.

Overall, this program provides a simple interactive interface for users to calculate the area of a rectangle. It demonstrates the use of the Scanner class for user input and control flow using loops and conditional statements.
